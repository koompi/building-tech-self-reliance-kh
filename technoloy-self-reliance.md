# Building a Self-Reliant Technological Nation

A strong nation is one that can rely on itself in all aspects to meet the needs of its people. Furthermore, it can export any surplus resources or capabilities to other countries in need. 

Cambodia currently possesses a surplus of low-skilled labor, which we export to Thailand, Korea, Japan, and other nations. However, this export of labor, while beneficial for our economy, may not be the most effective approach. If Cambodia could transform these workforces into skilled individuals capable of developing high-demand, high-tech products and services, which we could then sell, thus generating higher value.

Technology would also enable us to enhance domestic production, including food production, making it more efficient to feed the people and possible export more.

Like most parts of the world today, Cambodia is striving to become a self-reliant technological nation. While no country can achieve complete self-reliance, it should aspire to be as independent as possible, especially in the age of algorithms and artificial intelligence (AI).

To attain the status of a technologically self-reliant nation in this era, we must develop and maintain our own **hardware**, **firmware**, **operating systems (OS)**, and **applications**.

For **hardware**, we don't have to build everything ourselves. We can start with the easy parts, such as cases and other component designs, locally, and outsource the manufacturing when needed. Gradually, we could expand our involvement in more aspects of computing needs. This way, we can continue to progress and provide ample time to prepare our innovators to gain experience and build confidence.

Regarding **firmware**, since we have already commenced hardware development that includes firmware in collaboration with experienced outsourcers, such as those in China, we can explore the design and composition of firmware using the hardware they have produced for us. Additionally, we could initiate learning and piloting a new open-source CPU architecture called RISC-V along the way. This would pave the way for us to engage in chip manufacturing in the future. If we have a workforce capable of this, we could potentially make it happen in less than a decade.

An **operating system** holds a crucial role in computing, yet it often goes unnoticed today due to the shift towards cloud-based services. However, even cloud infrastructure relies on an operating system. To achieve technological self-reliance, we must educate ourselves and develop our own operating system, as it resides in every computing device we use daily, such as mobile phones, tablets, computers, TVs, servers, and more.

**Applications** are the final components that utilize the three aforementioned elements to create task-specific programs. As the number of applications multiplies, they can work together on an operating system to form an application platform, as exemplified by platforms like Facebook, Grab, WeChat, Telegram, and more.

Building such an ambitious goal wouldn't have been possible two to three decades ago without investing billions of dollars. Even with significant spending, the chances of success would have been slim. Fortunately, in the present day, we can achieve the mission of technological self-reliance if we meet two or three critical factors:
1. A committed workforce and a supportive community of users.
2. Adequate funding to incentivize the workforce and foster community development.
3. A willingness to build and utilize open source solutions to our advantage.

The third factor is the most crucial. If we do not prioritize open source usage, we may continue to opt for the familiar but not necessarily better or more straightforward options.

Leveraging open source to build and customize according to our specific needs is one of the most powerful strategies. Today, with the internet facilitating self-taught and peer-to-peer learning, our builders can take on missions from design to production without the necessity of formal education or face-to-face interactions with experts. While traditional education is valuable, creating an environment within educational institutions that fosters such development could accelerate progress by a factor of 100 or more.

## Notes: 

- A **Hardware** is refers to the physical, tangible components of a computing system. These are the physical devices and circuits that make up a computer or any electronic device.

- A **Firmware** is a type of software that is permanently or semi-permanently stored in hardware components. It serves as an intermediary layer between the hardware and the software (operating system and applications) and provides low-level control and functionality. 

- An **Operating System (OS)** is a crucial software component that serves as an intermediary between a computer's hardware and the user's software applications. Its primary purpose is to manage and coordinate all the hardware and software resources, providing a stable and user-friendly environment for executing programs and tasks.

- A **Software Application**, often referred to simply as an "application" or "app," is a computer program or a set of programs designed to perform specific tasks or functions for the user. These applications are designed to run on various computing devices, such as personal computers, smartphones, tablets, servers, and more. 

## Building a Thriving Open Source Community

The development of successful open-source projects often begins with a small group of individuals, sometimes even a single person, driven by specific needs. These projects then allow the community to grow organically, with some nurturing along the way.

In the world of open source, our approach should be one of complete openness. We should readily welcome code forking and encourage comments and feedback via pull requests from both known and unknown contributors. Our focus should be less on who contributes and more on what contributions bring to the table. What truly matters is the functionality and seamless integration of the code with the existing software.

Open source software maintainers, whether individual or a group, can thoroughly review pull requests and decide whether to integrate them or not. Contributors still retain the right to fork the base software and incorporate their contributions if they wish to see how their work fits. This approach ensures security for the core system while simultaneously fostering innovation beyond its boundaries. There are no strings attached or barriers blocking the path to innovation.

## Technology Initiatives in the Country

In Cambodia, several technology initiatives are making noticeable progress:

### Operating Systems by KOOMPI:

- **KOOMPI OS:** This is the KOOMPI Enterprise Operating System.

- **KramaOS:** A community version initiated by KOOMPI.

### Laptops and Computer Production by KOOMPI:

- KOOMPI is actively involved in the production of laptops and computers such as mini-PC and other electronics for R&D purposes.

- KOOMPI: In addition to its involvement in laptops and computers, KOOMPI is also expanding into PCB and PCBA design and manufacturing, as well as electronic case production in Cambodia.

### Hardware (IoT-Based) and Software Design:

- **ArrowDot:** Specializes in IoT-based hardware and software design.

- **Quantum Engineering and Manufacturing:** metal fabrication manufacturer. 

While these initiatives are notable, there are also various other projects and endeavors in the country that would require in-depth study to fully understand their scope and impact.

In summary, Cambodia possesses a wealth of resources and accumulated experience, which positions it well to embark on the development of more sophisticated technology products for its own needs and beyond.

# Roadmap and Suggestions

1. **Application Development:**
   - **Focus on Specific Solutions:** Consider concentrating efforts on developing specific solutions. For instance, administrative applications like MS Office are still essential in organizations and enterprises. Open-source alternatives to these applications are already 90% complete. To replace MS Office in our organizations, we primarily need to address Khmer language compatibility issues, such as providing a wider variety of Khmer fonts and improving some minor user interface elements.
   - **Compatibility Enhancement:** Address Khmer language compatibility issues, as these are already partially resolved. Additionally, consider creating a local cloud-based version of office applications for organizations to use at a minimal cost or for self-hosting.

2. **Operating System Development:**
   - **Leverage KOOMPI's KramaOS and KOOMPI OS:** Build upon KOOMPI's existing community version, KramaOS, and the enterprise version, KOOMPI OS. Both versions are based on Linux, making them fully open source and globally supported by open source contributors. This approach minimizes development costs and maintenance efforts.
   - **Explore Specific OS Builds:**
     - *Mobile OS:* Develop a mobile operating system that can connect to monitors to display a full Linux desktop OS. Unlike Samsung's DeX, this OS would provide the full power and functionality of a desktop OS on a larger screen.
     - *Server OS:* Create a specialized server operating system tailored for running our own cloud/server infrastructure.

Understanding the inner workings of the operating system and having the skilled workforce to customize it to our specific needs will open up numerous opportunities for technological advancement and progress.
